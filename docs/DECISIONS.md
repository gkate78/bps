- Decision: Standardize workflow around docs-based backlog + decision log + PowerShell helper script.
- Why: Keep planning and delivery consistent without introducing heavyweight tooling.
- Alternatives considered: external PM tools only, ad-hoc TODO files.
- Follow-up: Revisit if team size grows or CI pipeline is introduced.

- Decision: Adopt the PDF goals/brainstorm as the canonical product roadmap and map each idea into prioritized backlog items.
- Why: The PDF captures business intent, risks, and sequencing better than generic placeholders.
- Alternatives considered: continue with placeholder backlog, or prioritize by technical ease only.
- Follow-up: Re-rank `NOW/NEXT/LATER` every Friday based on incident risk, reconciliation impact, and operational speed.

- Decision: Add a dedicated `record_audit_logs` table and log record state changes (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `import_csv`) from route handlers with actor, channel, status, and detail metadata.
- Why: We need traceability of operational changes directly in admin tooling without relying on external logs.
- Alternatives considered: reusing auth event logs table, filesystem logs only, no UI exposure.
- Follow-up: Expand audit coverage to future record status transitions and add filter/search controls on the audit table if volume grows.
