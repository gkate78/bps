- Decision: Adopt the PDF goals/brainstorm as the canonical product roadmap and map each idea into prioritized backlog items.
- Why: The PDF captures business intent, risks, and sequencing better than generic placeholders.

- Follow-up: Re-rank `NOW/NEXT/LATER` every Friday based on incident risk, reconciliation impact, and operational speed.
